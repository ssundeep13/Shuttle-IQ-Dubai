// Reusable Claude AI matchmaking helper.
//
// Extracted from the admin "Auto Assign" path in server/routes.ts so the
// player-driven auto-matchmaking flow (server/auto-matchmaking.ts) can use
// the exact same prompt and response shape. The prompt is unchanged from
// the version that has been running in production for the admin Auto
// Assign — DO NOT modify wording lightly.
//
// The raw Anthropic call has a hard timeout (default 5s) via AbortController
// so that callers in latency-sensitive paths (player check-in fan-out)
// can still fall back to the standard algorithm if the API is slow.

Generate one court suggestion per available court.

RULES (all mandatory):
1. Never mix tiers (lower_intermediate 70-89, upper_intermediate
   90-109, advanced 110+) unless fewer than 4 players exist in a tier
2. Within-team score spread must not exceed 20 points
3. Always minimise the skill gap between team averages —
   lowest possible gap is always the best split
4. Prioritise players with fewer games this session
5. A player who is the only one in their tier is a lone outlier.
   Include them in suggestions using these rules:
   - Pair them with the player from the adjacent tier whose score
     is closest to theirs — this minimises the within-team spread
   - Their team's within-team spread limit is relaxed to 40 points
     since a same-tier partner is unavailable
   - The opposing team must still meet the normal 20-point spread limit
   - Among all valid splits always pick the one with the lowest
     skill gap
   - Label the card "Stretch Match" in amber so the admin knows
     a same-tier partner was unavailable
   - Show the reasoning field explaining who the outlier is and
     why this is the best available pairing
   - Do NOT exclude them — they must always appear in a suggestion

COURT SKILL BAND ASSIGNMENT:
There are ${courtCount} courts. Divide all eligible players into
${courtCount} skill bands of ${bandSize}% each by score,
highest scorers in Court 1:
${bandLines}

Each court suggestion must only use players from that court's band.
If a band has fewer than 4 players, expand to the adjacent band
and flag as Mixed Levels.
Return suggestions in court order, Court 1 first.

SESSION STATE:
Available courts: ${courtCount}
Session average games played: ${session.avgGames}

Players (sorted by score descending):
${session.players
  .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
  .map((p, i) => {
    const band = Math.ceil((i + 1) / session.players.length * courtCount);
    return `${p.name} | score:${p.score} | tier:${p.tier} | ` +
           `assignedCourt:${band} | ` +

// PLAYER-FLOW MATCHMAKING (separate prompt — DO NOT cross-pollute with the
// admin Auto Assign prompt above).
//
// Used by:
//   1. The very first match of a session (single-court request).
//   2. The "queued next-round" pass when 2+ occupied courts need a queued
//      lineup at the same time (multi-court request, batched into ONE
//      Anthropic call to keep the post-score latency in budget).
//
// Differences from the admin prompt:
//   - Carries each player's recentPartners / recentOpponents (last 3 of
//     each, newest first) so the AI can prefer fresh pairings/matchups.
//   - Carries each player's gender so the AI can prefer mixed-gender splits
//     when balance allows.
//   - Court requests can pin specific players via "must include" (used by
//     Case 2 of the queued orchestrator: at least one waiting player must
//     appear in the next lineup, the rest are filled from the active four
//     currently on that court).

PRINCIPLES (sorted most to least important — never sacrifice a higher principle for a lower one):
1. SKILL BALANCE — minimise the gap between Team 1's average score and Team 2's average score. Aim for a gap of 0. A gap above 10 is only acceptable when no smaller-gap split exists for the eligible players.
2. FRESH PARTNERS — avoid pairing a player with anyone in their "recentPartners" list. The newer the partner, the worse the repeat. Repeating is allowed only when every alternative has a worse skill gap.
3. FRESH OPPONENTS — when choosing the two opposing pairs, avoid putting a player against someone in their "recentOpponents" list. Same tiebreak rule as principle 2.
4. MIXED GENDER — when the principles above leave more than one acceptable split, prefer the split that puts one male and one female on each team. Never force this if it would harm balance or repeat partners.
5. WAIT FAIRNESS — when everything above is tied, prefer a lineup that includes the eligible player(s) with the highest "gamesWaited".
6. TIER — never put two players whose tiers are two steps apart on the same team unless no same-tier or one-step alternative exists. The tier order from low to high is: Novice < Beginner < lower_intermediate < upper_intermediate < Advanced < Professional.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Return exactly one suggestion per court request, in the same order.
- Each suggestion's team1 + team2 contains exactly 4 distinct players (2 per team).
- Pick names ONLY from that court's "available" list. Every name in that court's "must include" list MUST appear on team1 or team2.
- A player may only appear in ONE court's lineup across the whole response.
- Use the exact names from the input (case-sensitive).
